# TUHH - Threat Modeling Kata 

Resources for TUHH threat modeling kata session on Jun. 30th, 2025

## Setup

We'll use VSCode to create the diagrams using [graphviz](https://graphviz.org). Of course you can use any text editor for this, but there are nice plugins which allow you to see in real time the model, as you're editing.

To create [C4model](https://c4model.com) diagrams using graphviz, you need to install the [Graphviz Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EFanZh.graphviz-preview) marketplace plugin in VSCode

[dot.json](./dot.json) helps you have VS Code shortcuts when editing .dot or .gv files. Choose File->Preferences->User Snippets and select dot.json from the list. You can then insert the contents of the dot.json file here.

## Contents

Now that you're setup, here you can find the artifacts needed for the workshop:

* [Report.md](Report.md) contains the report upon which we'll work during the workshop
