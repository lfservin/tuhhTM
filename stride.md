|------------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spoofing               | 2    | An attacker could take over the port or socket that the server normally uses.                                                                                                       |
| Spoofing               | 3    | An attacker could try one credential after another and there's nothing to slow them down (online or offline)                                                                        |
| Spoofing               | 4    | An attacker can anonymously connect, because we expect authentication to be done at a higher level                                                                                  |
| Spoofing               | 5    | An attacker can confuse a client because there are too many ways to identify a server                                                                                               |
| Spoofing               | 6    | An attacker can spoof a server because identifiers aren't stored on the client and checked for consistency on re-connection (that is, there's no key persistence)                   |
| Spoofing               | 7    | An attacker can connect to a server or peer over a link that isn't authenticated (and encrypted)                                                                                    |
| Spoofing               | 8    | An attacker could steal credentials stored on the server and reuse them (for example, a key is stored in a world readable file)                                                     |
| Spoofing               | 9    | An attacker who gets a password can reuse it (Use stronger authenticators)                                                                                                          |

| Spoofing               | Q    | An attacker could go after the way credentials are updated or recovered (account recovery doesn't require disclosing the old password)                                              |
| Spoofing               | K    | Your system ships with a default admin password, and doesn't force a change                                                                                                         |

| Spoofing               | E    | We cannot tell which of our admins edited personal data, as admin accounts are shared.                                                                                              |

| Tampering              | 3    | An attacker can take advantage of your custom key exchange or integrity control which you built instead of using standard crypto                                                    |
| Tampering              | 4    | Your code makes access control decisions all over the place, rather than with a security kernel                                                                                     |

| Tampering              | 7    | An attacker can bypass permissions because you don't make names canonical before checking access permissions                                                                        |
| Tampering              | 8    | An attacker can manipulate data because there's no integrity protection for data on the network                                                                                     |
| Tampering              | 9    | An attacker can provide or control state information                                                                                                                                |
| Tampering              | 10   | An attacker can alter information in a data store because it has weak/open permissions or includes a group which is equivalent to everyone ("anyone with a Facebook account")       |
| Tampering              | J    | An attacker can write to some resource because permissions are granted to the world or there are no ACLs                                                                            |
| Tampering              | Q    | An attacker can change parameters over a trust boundary and after validation (for example, important parameters in a hidden field in HTML, or passing a pointer to critical memory) |
| Tampering              | K    | An attacker can load code inside your process via an extension point                                                                                                                |

| Tampering              | E    | Data in the database can be 'fixed' by the admins, and nobody will ever know.                                                                                                       |
| Repudiation            | 2    | An attacker can pass data through the log to attack a log reader, and there's no documentation of what sorts of validation are done                                                 |
| Repudiation            | 3    | A low privilege attacker can read interesting security information in the logs                                                                                                      |
| Repudiation            | 4    | An attacker can alter digital signatures because the digital signature system you're implementing is weak, or uses MACs where it should use a signature                             |
| Repudiation            | 5    | An attacker can alter log messages on a network because they lack strong integrity controls                                                                                         |
| Repudiation            | 6    | An attacker can create a log entry without a timestamp (or no log entry is timestamped)                                                                                             |

| Repudiation            | J    | An attacker can edit logs and there's no way to tell (perhaps because there's no heartbeat option for the logging system)                                                           |

| Inference              | 2    | We use a common identifier across all the systems, and also expose this to third parties.                                                                                           |

| Retention/Removal      | 3    | All personal data goes into a large pile in the cloud, and going through it to find individual records would cost a fortune in retrieval and outbound data transfer fees.           |
| Retention/Removal      | 4    | We store personal data on disk, even though we only need it temporarily and could just cache it in memory.                                                                          |

| Transfer               | 3    | We provide an API that ingests personal data, but we do not know whether we are a data processor or a data controller, and it's not defined in our contracts.                       |
| Transfer               | 4    | We call an API with personal data, but we do not know where the API is being hosted geographically.                                                                                 |
